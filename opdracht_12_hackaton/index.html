            I got my first camera at age 11.
        </p>

            My brother, who is 5 years older, got one first and I was very jealous and disappointed that I did not get
            one. I was supposed to be too young. But after nagging for a long time, I got my first camera for my 11th
            birthday. It was a small Kodak Instamatic and I was the king of the world! Later I got some other small
            camera's, better but still not professional.
        </p>
        <p>
            At age 21 I got my first 'real'camera, the Nikon F510, with a 35mm/70mm lens. From that moment on I started
            to take compositions more and more serious.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first digital camera was a D70, then I made the step to a fullframe camera, the D2, then the D3FX, then
            the D4 and the D810 and D850.

            Check out the several projects to get a glimpse of the subjects I like to put in front of my lenses...
